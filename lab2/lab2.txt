Counting unigrams and bigrams
Read and try programs to compute the frequency of unigrams and bigrams of the training set: [Program folder].
What is the possible number of bigrams and their real number? Explain why such a difference. What would be the possible number of 4-grams.
Propose a solution to cope with bigrams unseen in the corpus. This topic will be discussed during the lab session.


selma:
words: 962204
bigrams: 962203

possible bigrams = 962204^2 = 925836537616
possible 4-grams = 962204^4
